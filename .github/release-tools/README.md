# Release matrix

English | [Русский](README_RU.md)

> Historical upstream release-matrix design. The RU fork uses the tag-only `RU Release` workflow instead.

The release workflow builds the frontend once, then runs each configured Go target on its own Linux runner. `CGO_ENABLED=0` permits cross-compilation. The target matrix is read from `.goreleaser.yaml`, including its exclusions; simple releases select Linux amd64 only.

Each build uses GoReleaser OSS in snapshot mode with the selected release version and one target. Archive naming, bundled files, Go flags and release templates remain in the existing GoReleaser configurations. Every archive is accompanied by its source commit, target, version and SHA256. The publishing job verifies the complete matrix before building images or publishing. It uses GoReleaser's `extra_files` support to publish existing archives and checksums, with builds disabled. No Pro license is needed.

Go caches are isolated by target and refreshed on each source commit, with fallback to the preceding target cache. Save uses the original restore key, even if a build hook changes `go.sum`. Matrix jobs upload uniquely named artifacts. The publishing job extracts only the regular Linux binary from each verified archive and restores its executable permission before constructing Docker contexts. QEMU remains limited to runtime-image instructions. DockerHub images are omitted when its credentials are absent; GHCR is always retained. Simple mode still publishes only the amd64 GHCR image and the simple release description.

All build jobs use the commit resolved by `prepare`, including a manual release's selected tag. Helper scripts come from the workflow revision and are passed as a run-local artifact, so older application tags do not need to contain the new scripts. The workflow serializes release runs to prevent simultaneous updates to moving image tags.

## Validation in the RU fork

The RU fork's `release.yml` has no `workflow_dispatch` or `dry_run` mode. Do not invoke it from a branch. Before creating a new immutable release tag, follow the RU release runbook: require exact-commit branch CI and Security Scan, then verify the non-publishing GoReleaser snapshot and multi-platform Buildx rehearsals on that same commit. Rehearsal alone is not publication or verification of downloadable assets.

Helper checks:

```bash
python -m pip install -r .github/release-tools/requirements-release.txt
python -m unittest discover -s .github/release-tools -p 'test_release_matrix.py'
bash -n .github/release-tools/release-images.sh
```
